            â€¢ A partitioning group is a group separating two hexes outside the group, in the sense that all paths between the two hexes go through the group.
            â€¢ You're not allowed to place adjacent to a friendly partitioning group.
            â€¢ When a group becomes partitioning, remove all nonpartitioning groups adjacent to it.
            
        The pie rule is used to balance the game. It can be turned off in the options.")
